# Bioacoustic-Analysis-for-Classification-of-Bird-Calls-using-R
The following code is the workflow used to classify yellow-billed babbler calls that were recorded and analysed on RavenPro software. This classification was then used to verify a preliminary classification based on behaviour by visualising the results of Discriminant Functional Analysis (DFA).

1. The data was recorded from field observations of Yellow-billed Babbler groups.
2. Audio files in .WAV format were input in RavenPro software
3. Selection tables from RavenPro were read in R
4. Selection tables were subject to data cleaning
5. Running stats test
6. Visualizing results
